**Stable Diffusion** is a machine learning AI that turns text (or images) into images. For instance, "knight in shiny armor, fantasy art" becomes a glorious 1024x768 painting in seconds.

You'll find a class to connect Unity to a local API, which you can install by following [these instructions](https://sphuff.dev/automatic-now-has-an-api).

Alternatively, you can also connect to the paid [Replicate.com](https://replicate.com) with your account there.

**GPT-3** is a deep learning artificial intelligence which continues a given text prompt. For instance, as you can try for yourself in the [OpenAI playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground), the text "Albert Einstein was" gets completed with "born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents were ..." and more.
